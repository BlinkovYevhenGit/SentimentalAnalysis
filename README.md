**ABSTRACT**

**Structure and scope of work.** The explanatory note of the diploma project consists of five sections, contains 26 figures, 7 tables, 1 appendix, 17 sources.

The diploma project is devoted to automation of processes of the sentimental analysis of texts, applying various algorithms, and comparison of efficiency of these algorithms. This project describes the methods of sentimental analysis of texts and principles of their application in the development of information technology for text sentimental analysis.

The information support section provided sets of input and output data, as well as described their format, structure and purpose in the software product.

The section of mathematical support is primarily devoted to the description of meaningful and mathematical formulations of the problem, as well as key methods for solving the problem. In addition, the rationale for the choice of these methods for their implementation in the software product.

The software section lists the development tools that have been used in this software product, as well as how the web application works in the form of various diagrams.

The technological section provides user guidance for using this program, as well as describes the test results.
